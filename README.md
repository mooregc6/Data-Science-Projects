# George Housing Code 
Is an housing regression analysis of a housing data set that was uploaded from kaggle to see if given parameters that make up a good, fair or bad house were we able to use machine learning to model and predict a good sale price for these homes



# George Star Classification Code 
In this supervised learning star data set we will be using the location, the average frequenicy mode, the maximum frequency mode of either a Red Giant or a Helium Burning Star to run a machine learning model and create predictions so that in the future we will be able to just plug these 3 corresponding values of an unclassified star into the model and be able to determine if that star is either a Red Giant or Helium Burning Star.
