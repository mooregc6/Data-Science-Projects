# George Housing Code 
Is an housing regression analysis of a housing data set that was uploaded from kaggle to see if given parameters that make up a good, fair or bad house were we able to use machine learning to model and predict a good sale price for these homes. The best model had price out houses with an std of about 25 or 26 thousand dollars based on top 20 to 30 positvely or negatively correlated features.



# George Star Classification Code 
In this supervised learning star data set we will be using the location, the average frequenicy mode, the maximum frequency mode of either a Red Giant or a Helium Burning Star to run a machine learning model and create predictions so that in the future we will be able to just plug these 3 corresponding values of an unclassified star into the model and be able to determine if that star is either a Red Giant or Helium Burning Star. The machine learning model provided us with an 99 percent accuracy score.



# Fake News Classification
In this project I took two different data sets one full of fake news and the other full of real news. In the code we focused on be able to determine whether or not the news would be fake based on the title of the news article. Best model provided us with and 95 - 96 percent accuracy score.
